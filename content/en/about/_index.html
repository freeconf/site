FreeCONF is a sophisticated, open source, software library that seamlessly integrates with popular DevOps tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and InfluxDB, leveraging a universally-accepted communication protocol known as RESTCONF. This protocol, which bears some resemblance to gRPC, has been tailored specifically for management purposes, and facilitates streamlined and automated workflow management. By obviating the requirement for additional software installation or manual configuration file modifications, FreeCONF empowers DevOps teams to work with unprecedented efficiency and focus on mission-critical objectives.
