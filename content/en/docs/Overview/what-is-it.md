FreeCONF is a software library designed to simplify the management of various software applications by streamlining the integration process and enabling users to concentrate on automation. The library provides constructs for managing configuration, metrics, alerts, function execution, and security of the applications.

What sets FreeCONF apart from other solutions is its utilization of well-established IETF standards such as RESTCONF and YANG.

Users are free to incorporate as much or as little of FreeCONF into their applications to suit their needs. Additionally, tools may interact with applications through the REST API or construct a model from a management manifest, or even provide automatic inventory registration services.
