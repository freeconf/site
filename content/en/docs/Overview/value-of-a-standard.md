Standards obviate the need for integration because both sides can communicate directly with each other using a predetermined protocol. Most DevOps tools require the community to help build and maintain all the integrations specific to that tool.

Standards like TCP/IP allowed computers from different networks to communicate without having support for each other's specific networking stack.  SMTP did the same for electronic messages amd HTML/HTTP did it for information.

The RESTCONF/YANG is already the standard for network management and poised to be the next standard for all systems management. 

## Aren't defacto standards good enough?

> *"Tool X is the defacto standard for doing this in the industry so I don't see the need for an official standard"*

Every standard, defacto or official has a life span. Defacto ones might be a few years, official ones can last decades. When a standard lasts long enough for an application to ship with support built in, it changes the game.  An application with built in support does not rely on fragmented set of communities to fill the gap sometime later.  When support is implemented by the application developers it tends to be complete because they know the application the best.

## Additional reading

To get an understanding of the genesis and impact of standards you can read the book [Where the Wizards Stay Up Late](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Wizards-Stay-Up-Late-audiobook/dp/B00AQU7OFS/ref=sr_1_1) to appreciate the before and after of each standard.
