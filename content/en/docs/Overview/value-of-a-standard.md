Standards obviate the need for integration because both sides can communicate directly with each other. Most DevOps tools require the community to help build and maintain all the integrations.

It is worth mentioning standards like TCP/IP allowed computers from different networking stacks communicate for the first time without having support each other's networking model.  SMTP did the same for electronic messages amd HTML/HTTP did it for information.

The RESTCONF/YANG standard is poised to be the next standard for all systems management, in addition to already being the standard for network management. 

## Aren't Defacto Standards are Good Enough?

> *"Tool X is the defacto standard for doing this in the industry so I don't see the need for an official standard"*

Every standard, defacto or official has a life span. Defacto ones might be a few years, official ones can last many decades. When a standard lasts long enough for an application to ship with support built in, it changes the game.  An application with built in support does not rely on fragmented set of communities to fill the gap sometime later.  When support is implemented by the application developers they know the application the best.
