  Always more work to do.

FreeCONF is a production ready library, but there a lot more things to add.  FreeCONF is driven by you and your needs so [speak up](https://github.com/orgs/freeconf/discussions)!

* **Support for more languages** - Only Go is supported today but Python is in the works.  FreeCONF would like to add support for more languages Java, Rust, Node, C# and Ruby.
* **Support for more parts of the standard** - YANG Push would be useful.
* **Support for additional communication protocols** - RESTCONF and gNMI are great first protocols but adding more would increase tool support
