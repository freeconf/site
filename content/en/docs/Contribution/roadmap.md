FreeCONF is a production ready library, but there a lot more things to add that 

* **Support for more languages** - Only Go is supported today but Python is in the works.  FreeCONF would like to add support for more languages Java, Rust, Node, C# and Ruby.
* **Support for more parts of the standard** - YANG Push would be useful
* **Support for additional communication protocols** - RESTCONF is a great first protocol because it is easy for tools to consume but gNMI accomplishes that same features but is a bit more efficient which can be important when handling a lot of metrics.
