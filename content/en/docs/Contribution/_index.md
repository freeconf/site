## Reporting an Issue or Requesting a Feature

If you've found a problem in the code or the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [Issue DB](https://github.com/freeconf/restconf/issues).

## Have a Code Fix

Open an issue describing your fix and then submit a merge request.

## Starting a Discussion

Not sure if you found a problem, have a general question or want to solicit feedback on an idea. Post to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/freeconf/discussions) forum.

## Documentation

*(i.e. this doc)*

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website but there's a good chance that if your contribution is fairly typical, then you can just markdown and not have to install Hugo locally.
