## Code Fix

## Reporting an Issue

If you've found a problem in the code or the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [Github repo](https://github.com/freeconf/restconf).

## Starting a Discussion


## Documentation

*(i.e. this doc)*

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website but there's a good chance that if your contribution is fairly typical, then you can just markdown and not have to install Hugo locally.
