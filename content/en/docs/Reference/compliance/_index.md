  Items of note regarding IETF RFC compliance
---

FreeCONF's intentions is for strict compliance with IETF RFCs and OpenConfig to allow interoperability with other tools.  In order to make the standards appeal to a more general audiance however, FreeCONF has a few extensions that detailed below. If you find a violation or concern, please bringing this to the attention of the project via an issue or discussion. Any ommisions in compliance are likely due to limited resources to implement and contributions would be welcomed.
